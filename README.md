- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Rodriguez ! This is my new GitHub repository, I lost acess to my old repository [Old danrod's GitHub profile](https://github.com/danrod96) and I couldn't recover it, lesson learnt !!
- 👀 I’m interested in **Drupal stuff**, I am maintainer of many contrib modules and I love making contributions to other modules and Drupal Core when time permits, please check out my drupal.org profile: [Daniel R's Drupal.org profile](https://www.drupal.org/u/danrod)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning other frameworks and programming languages: JavaScript (**React / NodeJS / TypeScript / Next.js**) **Golang** (For building scalable and robust web applications, I believe PHP has become kind of outdated). I also do some **C/C++** for fun (not for profit) and in the near future I'd like to do some Linux Kernel Development just for fun.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Drupal.org contrib modules that I maintain and submit patches to many of the apps I use.
- 📫 How to reach: I'm trying to set up a personal web page with a form that you will use to reach me, in the meantime, I'm around in the drupal.slack.com most of the time (check out for my full name).
- 😄 Pronouns: What's this sorry?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm Catholic by heart, but I am also exploring my Sephardic ancestors, I consider myself libertarian, but I also believe in the Laws of God.
